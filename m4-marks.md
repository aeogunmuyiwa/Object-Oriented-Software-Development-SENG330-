# Marking Guide    / 40

# Interim Marks 13/25

# Product Requirements 3/5 
This is about meeting the requirements identified in the problem statement. 

- initially you had basically nothing, but some heroic effort seems to have wired in more use cases, which I have accounted for.

# Product Quality 3/5
This is about the content of the pitch.

- most of it was in Django shell, which doesn't really count.
- email validation seems to be in place.
- after the deadline it was possible to see more working

# Technical Briefing 5/10
This is about the content of the technical portion of the pitch. Every team member should expect to be asked about the technical details of the project. Sample question: "how is this controller wired to this view".

- your design was just Django, but it wasn't clear whether any more thought had gone into it.
- not clear who did what. No evidence of deployment concepts being addressed.

# Presentation "Pitch" Marks 2/5
This is about the professionalism and presentation of your pitch and tech brief.

- presentation was disjointed 
- hard to assess given the lack of working product. 
- projector trouble for the beginning.

# Code and Design Quality /15
Note that you have until Friday before the code quality gets marked. NB: Many of the items here can be 'tested' with BetterCodeHub. In other words, a low BCH score will be a negative signal for me about this aspect.

- clarity and maintainability of the code (organization, packaging, class size)
- documentation is useful and present throughout
- code has unit tests
- code shows evidence of design principles such as SOLID, Design Patterns used where appropriate
- language and frameworks chosen are used properly (e.g. following Python idioms like list comprehensions)
- no obvious design smells like God Class, lack of refactoring, helpful names

# Bonus 0/12.5 (project: 5%)
- Travis CI, Junit, Docker, etc are used in meaningful way (integral part of development process)
